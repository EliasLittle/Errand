# Errand Language

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a new programming language that features a simple yet powerful syntax that can be simultaneously great for high level and low level programming. 

It will accomplish this by utilizing
- A strong type system
- Multiple dispatch (like Julia)
- Combination of functional and imperative programming

## Status

- **Lexer**: A lexer that tokenizes the source code into meaningful tokens. (Completed)
- **Parser**: A parser that constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens. (WIP)
- **Interpreter**: TODO
- **Compiler**: TODO
